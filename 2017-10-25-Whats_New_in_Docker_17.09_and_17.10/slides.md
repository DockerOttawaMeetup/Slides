## About the Kubernetes support...

- (private?) beta coming soon (sign up at https://docker.com/kubernetes)
- initial focus is on Docker EE, and Docker for Mac/Windows - Docker CE Linux
  support on roadmap (post 2018 Q1)
- all EE features (DTR, private registry, scanning, etc) will work with both Swarmkit and K8s
- shipping "vanilla" k8s from CNCF - no wrapping involved (using LinuxKit)
- "opinionated" stack - "batteries included" (networking, storage) - and _eventually_ swappable
- _No plans to drop Swarm support_
