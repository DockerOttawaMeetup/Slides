## Notable features in 18.09

### Deprecations are features! üíÄ

- Removed support for TLS < 1.2 [moby/moby#37660](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/37660)
- Removed Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 8 as supported platforms [docker/docker-ce-packaging#255](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/255) / [docker/docker-ce-packaging#254](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/254)

## Notable features in 18.09

### Connection to Docker Engine over SSH üîê

- Add support for remote connections using SSH [docker/cli#1014](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1014)
  - `docker -H ssh://me@my-server run hello-world`
  - or `export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://me@server`
  - just shells out to `ssh` so `~/.ssh/config` is honoured

- Support for build-time secrets with `--secret` flag [docker/cli#1288](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1288)
- SSH agent socket forwarder (`docker build --ssh`) [docker/cli#1438](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1438) / [docker/cli#1419](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1419)
